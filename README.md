# BlenderMaterialsToVMAT
A simple script that converts all scene materials into simple Source 2 VMAT files

# Usage
* Open a new Text Editor window in Blender.
* Paste the script into the Text Editor.
* Click on Run Script.
* Converted VMATS should appear inside /Desktop/cool_mats/


I recommend reading through the comments to understand what this script does, especially if you are working with more complex Blender materials, and adjusting the script accordingly.
